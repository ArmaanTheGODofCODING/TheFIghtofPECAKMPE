Once upon a time, there used to live a hero called Penciltaliite. One day, a brilliantly bad villaian came to Penciltaliite's town. Its name was 
Erasertallite. He attacked and attacked until Penciltaliite WON. There was peace for 1000000000000000000000000 years until Erasertallite came
again, He was very much stronger and had hypnotised Penciltaliite's brother Pentatallite and Compastallite. They fought and fought until Erasertallite won
About 96897879887089898989898 years later, A new hero rose.  His name was ArmaanKapoortallite. Once ArmaanKapoortallite rose for 2700000000000000000000000000000000 years another Villian came 
called Mastertallite. He fought but didn't won becuse ArmaanKapoortallite used his coding superpowers and vomitted on him. Did you know? He was VERY VERY VERY VERY hygenic.
